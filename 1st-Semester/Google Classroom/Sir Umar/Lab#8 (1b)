How does the round() function operate in Python, and in what situations would you use it? Give an example.

Ans:
# Example 1: Round to the nearest integer
number1 = 3.6
rounded_number1 = round(number1)
print("Rounded number:", rounded_number1)  # Output: 4

# Example 2: Round to a specified number of decimal places
number2 = 3.14159
rounded_number2 = round(number2, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places
print("Rounded number:", rounded_number2)  # Output: 3.14
