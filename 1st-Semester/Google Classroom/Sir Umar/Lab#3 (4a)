The program asks for two number from the user and then checks whether the numbers are:
a. Positive
b. Atleast one of them is positive
c. Negative 
d. Atleast one of them is negative
e. Even 
f. Atleast one of them is even
g. Odd
h. Atleast one of them is odd
i. Multiple of 3 
j. Atleast one of them is multiple of 3
Use the print statement similar to the one shown in lab task 3 to display the result. 

Output:

Num1 = float(input(“Enter the first number: “))
Num2 = float(input(“Enter the second number: “))

print(“a. Both numbers are positive:”, num1 > 0 and num2 > 0)

print(“b. At least one number is positive:”, num1 > 0 or num2 > 0)

print(“c. Both numbers are negative:”, num1 < 0 and num2 < 0)

print(“d. At least one number is negative:”, num1 < 0 or num2 < 0)

print(“e. Both numbers are even:”, num1 % 2 == 0 and num2 % 2 == 0)

print(“f. At least one number is even:”, num1 % 2 == 0 or num2 % 2 == 0)

print(“g. Both numbers are odd:”, num1 % 2 != 0 and num2 % 2 != 0)

print(“h. At least one number is odd:”, num1 % 2 != 0 or num2 % 2 != 0)

print(“i. Both numbers are multiples of 3:”, num1 % 3 == 0 and num2 % 3 == 0)

print(“j. At least one number is a multiple of 3:”, num1 % 3 == 0 or num2 % 3 == 0)
