Create another file named “lab3_2.py”. Write a program that takes three input values from the user i.e.,A,B and C. It then computes values of arithmetic operations among A, B, and C. Run the program for multiple values and observe which operations are associative. (Hint: Assoaciticty property states that 
rearranging operands with parenthesis doesnot affect the output, i.e., a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c. ).

Output:

A = float(input("Enter the first number (A): "))
B = float(input("Enter the second number (B): "))
C = float(input("Enter the third number (C): "))

addition_1 = A + (B + C)  # a + (b + c)
addition_2 = (A + B) + C  # (a + b) + c
multiplication_1 = A * (B * C)  # a * (b * c)
multiplication_2 = (A * B) * C  # (a * b) * c

print("Addition (a + (b + c)):", addition_1)
print("Addition ((a + b) + c):", addition_2)
print("Multiplication (a * (b * c)):", multiplication_1)
print("Multiplication ((a * b) * c):", multiplication_2)
