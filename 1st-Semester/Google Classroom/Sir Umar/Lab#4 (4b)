Consider the following code: What will be the output?
x = 0
a = 5
b = 5
if a > 0:
 if b < 0: 
 x = x + 5 
 elif a > 5:
 x = x + 4
 else:
 x = x + 3
else:
 x = x + 2
print(x)


Output:

Write the output of the following code
a = 25
if a > 15:
 print("Hi")
if a <= 30:
 print("Hello")
else:
 print("Good bye!")
