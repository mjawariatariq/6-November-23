To use a unique key for each record. This way, every student will be assigned a
unique number and two students with same name can be added to the students_dict.

students_dict = {}
next_student_id = 1 

def add_student(name):
    global next_student_id  
    students_dict[next_student_id] = name
    print("Student", name, "added successfully with ID", next_student_id)
    next_student_id += 1  # Increment the student ID counter for the next student

add_student('Jawaria')
add_student('Hava')
add_student('Sadia')  

print(students_dict)
