Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter 5 numbers, stores them in a list, and then prints the sum of all even numbers in the list.


Output:

numbers = []

for i in range(5):
    num = int(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
    numbers.append(num)


even_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)


print("Sum of even numbers:", even_sum)
