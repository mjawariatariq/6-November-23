Generate a list of 50 integers. Write a program that iterates through the list and prints the square of each number if it's even, and the cube if it's odd.

Output:

integer_list = list(range(1, 51))

for num in integer_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Square of {num}: {num**2}")

    else:
        print(f"Cube of {num}: {num**3}")
