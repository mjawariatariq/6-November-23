Use variables to store item names, quantities, and prices. Calculate the total cost of items and check if you have enough budget.


items_names = (input("Enter Items Name"))

item_names = ('candy', 'scissor', 'glasses', 'shoes')

price = [2.5, 2.6, 4.2, 6.2]

quantity= [5, 1 , 2 , 2]

budget = 5.0

total_cost = sum(quantity * price for quantity, price in zip (quantity, price))

if total_cost <= budget:

print("You're in Budget")

else:

print("Out of Budget")
