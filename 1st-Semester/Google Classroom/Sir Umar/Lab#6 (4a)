Create “lab6_4.py”. Create a tuple containing the names of 5 countries. Write a program that iterates 
through the tuple and prints only the countries with a length greater than 7 characters.


Output:


countries = ('United States', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'Netherlands', 'Switzerland')


print("Countries with a length greater than 7 characters:")

for country in countries:
    if len(country) > 7:

        print(country)
