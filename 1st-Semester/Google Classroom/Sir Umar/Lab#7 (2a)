Check for a duplicate key before saving a new item in the dictionary. In case anitem is already available in the students_dict, then the program should warn the user.

students_dict = {
    101: 'Jawaria',
    105: 'Zainab',
    108: 'Hava'
}

def add_student(id, name):
    if id in students_dict:
        print("Warning: Student with ID", id, "already exists.")
    else:
        students_dict[id] = name
        print("Student added successfully.")

add_student(101, 'Ali')  
add_student(103, 'John')

print(students_dict)
