What is the difference between append and extend methods of a list?

Answer:

The `append` and `extend` methods in Python are both used to add elements to a list, but they differ in how they add those elements:

1. `append`: This method adds a single element to the end of the list. It takes a single argument, which is the element to be added. If the element is a list, it will be added as a single element, not as individual elements.

   Example:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_list.append(4)
   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

2. `extend`: This method adds all the elements from an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or another iterable) to the end of the list. It takes a single argument, which is the iterable whose elements are to be added to the list.

   Example:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   another_list = [4, 5, 6]
   my_list.extend(another_list)
   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

In summary, `append` adds a single element to the end of the list, while `extend` adds all the elements from an iterable to the end of the list.
