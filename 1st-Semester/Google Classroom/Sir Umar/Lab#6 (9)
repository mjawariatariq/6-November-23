Write a Python program that takes a list of student names and their corresponding 
grades as key-value pairs in a dictionary. The program should then prompt the user to enter a student 
name, and it should output the grade associated with that student. If the student is not found in the 
dictionary, the program should print a message saying "Student not found.


Output:

student_grades = {
    'Alice': 85,
    'Bob': 92,
    'Charlie': 78,
    'David': 88,
    'Emma': 95
}

student_name = input("Enter student name: ")

if student_name in student_grades:
    
    print(f"Grade of {student_name}: {student_grades[student_name]}")
else:
    
    print("Student not found.")
