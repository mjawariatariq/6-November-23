Write a program that generates a list of odd numbers from 1 to 1000, prints numbers and then prints the sum of numbers. 

Output:

odd_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 1001) if num % 2 != 0]


print("Odd numbers from 1 to 1000:")
print(odd_numbers)


sum_odd_numbers = sum(odd_numbers)
print("Sum of odd numbers:", sum_odd_numbers)
