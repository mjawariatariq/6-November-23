Write a program that inputs a number and then determines whether the entered number is odd, even or 0.

Output:

Number = int(input(“Enter a number: “))
If number == 0:
    print(“The entered number is 0.”)
elif number % 2 == 0:
    print(“The entered number is even.”)
else:
    print(“The entered number is odd.”)
