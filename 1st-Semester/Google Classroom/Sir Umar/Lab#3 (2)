The operators that satisfy the associative property are addition and multiplication. 

For addition, the associative property states that (a + b) + c is equal to a + (b + c).

For multiplication, the associative property states that (a * b) * c is equal to a * (b * c).


A = float(input("Enter the first number (A): "))
B = float(input("Enter the second number (B): "))
C = float(input("Enter the third number (C): "))

addition_1 = A + (B + C)  # a + (b + c)
addition_2 = (A + B) + C  # (a + b) + c
multiplication_1 = A * (B * C)  # a * (b * c)
multiplication_2 = (A * B) * C  # (a * b) * c

print("Addition (a + (b + c)):", addition_1)
print("Addition ((a + b) + c):", addition_2)
print("Multiplication (a * (b * c)):", multiplication_1)
print("Multiplication ((a * b) * c):", multiplication_2)
