The addition and multiplication operators are commutative. For example, 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2, and 4 * 5 is the same as 5 * 4.On the other hand, subtraction and division are not commutative because the order of the operands matters. For example, 5 - 3 is not the same as 3 - 5, and 10 / 2 is not the same as 2 / 10.


A = float(input(“Enter the first number (A): “))
B = float(input(“Enter the second number (B): “))

Addition = A + B
Subtraction = A – B
Multiplication = A * B
Division = A / B
Modulo = A % B
Exponentiation = A ** B
