Write a program that takes two sets as input and prints the union of the two sets.

Output:

set1_input = input("Enter elements of the first set separated by spaces: ")
set1 = set1_input.split()


set2_input = input("Enter elements of the second set separated by spaces: ")
set2 = set2_input.split()


set1 = set(set1)
set2 = set(set2)


union_set = set1.union(set2)


print("Union of the two sets:", union_set)
