Write a program that prints Fibonacci series.

Ans: 

Num_terms = int(input(“Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series: “))

A, b = 0, 1

print(“Fibonacci series:”)

for _ in range(num_terms):

    print(a, end=” “)

    A, b = b, a + b


Output:

Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series: 4
Fibonacci series:
0 1 1 2
