Enlist the operators for lab task 2 that satisfy associative property.

Output:

In your provided code, the operations that satisfy the associative property are:

1. Addition:
   - `addition_1 = A + (B + C)`  # a + (b + c)
   - `addition_2 = (A + B) + C`  # (a + b) + c

2. Multiplication:
   - `multiplication_1 = A * (B * C)`  # a * (b * c)
   - `multiplication_2 = (A * B) * C`  # (a * b) * c

These operations will produce the same result regardless of how the operands are grouped with parentheses. So, both addition and multiplication satisfy the associative property in this context.
