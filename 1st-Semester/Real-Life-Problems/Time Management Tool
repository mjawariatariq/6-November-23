Use variables to store task names and durations. Write expressions to calculate total time spent on each task and identify areas for improvement.


tasks = {
    "Task 1": 30,
    "Task 2": 45,
    "Task 3": 60,
    "Task 4": 20
}


total_times = {task: duration for task, duration in tasks.items()}


total_time = sum(total_times.values())


average_time = total_time / len(tasks)
areas_for_improvement = [task for task, duration in total_times.items() if duration > average_time]


print("Total time spent on each task:")
for task, duration in total_times.items():
     print(f"{task}: {duration} minutes")


print("\nTotal time spent on all tasks:", total_time, "minutes")


print("\nAreas for improvement (tasks taking more than average time):", areas_for_improvement)
