Input two numbers from the user. Then, using the comparison operators from Table-1, print the results using print function for all the comparison 
operations between both numbers. For example, you can print the result of equal operator (==) using the following print statement.print("A==B is",a==b)
The above statement will print the result of a==b as either True or False.

Output:

A = float(input(“Enter the first number (A): “))
B = float(input(“Enter the second number (B): “))

print(“A == B is”, A == B)
print(“A != B is”, A != B)
print(“A < B is”, A < B)
print(“A > B is”, A > B)
print(“A <= B is”, A <= B)
print(“A >= B is”, A >= B)
