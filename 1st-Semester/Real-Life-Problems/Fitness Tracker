Create variables to store daily steps, distance walked, and calories burned. Write expressions to calculate average steps per week and total distance covered in a month. total_steps = int(input("Enter the steps:"))


average_distance = int(input("Enter Distance:"))

days_in_month = 30

average_steps_per_Week = (total_steps) / 7

total_distance = (average_steps_per_Week) * (average_distance) * (days_in_month)

print(total_distance)
