Using the input function, take two numbers from the user and store them in variables ‘A’ and ‘B’. Compute the values of performing all the arithmetic operations shown in Table -1 between A and B. Run the program multiple times with different input values. Observe the output. Which of the arithmetic operations commutative property? (Hint: An operation is commutative if the order of operands does not affect the  
result e.g., a+b=b+a).


Output:

A = float(input(“Enter the first number (A): “))
B = float(input(“Enter the second number (B): “))

Addition = A + B
Subtraction = A – B
Multiplication = A * B
Division = A / B
Modulo = A % B
Exponentiation = A ** B
