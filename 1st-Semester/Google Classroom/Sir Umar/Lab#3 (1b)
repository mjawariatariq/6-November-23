write which operators are commutative and which are not.

Output:

- Addition and multiplication are commutative operators.
- Subtraction, division, modulo, and exponentiation are not commutative operators.
Addition = A + B  # Commutative
Subtraction = A - B  # Non-commutative
Multiplication = A * B  # Commutative
Division = A / B  # Non-commutative
Modulo = A % B  # Commutative
Exponentiation = A ** B  # Commutative
